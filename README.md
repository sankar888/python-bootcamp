# How to create virtual environment for python
A Python Virtual Environment is an isolated space where you can work on your Python projects, separately from your system-installed Python. You can set up your own libraries and dependencies without affecting the system Python.

The venv module supports creating lightweight “virtual environments”, each with their own independent set of Python packages installed in their site directories.
```sh
python -m venv C:\path\to\new\virtual\environment
```
